There will be two types of files needed for this:
1. Scene Export from OBS
2. Lioranboard configs for the streamdecks

Since you are here, I am assuming that you followed the Lioranboard instructions and have tested it as working with the websocket.

Download all the files in this folder to your system

Preparing OBS:
Open OBS and then under Scenes, import the "Interactive Phasmo" scene file that you just downloaded.

Preparing Lioranboard:
Navigate to the folder where you're running Lioran board and find the last number you have on a config file.  Name the config and config1 the next 2 numbers in the series and copy them to the folder.

For example:  If you have config, config1, config2 and nothing else, then name the files config3 and config4 before copying them into the folder.

You can then open Lioranboard and see the two new streamdecks added to your list: Phasmophobia Stream and Phasmo Names.

Phasmophobia Stream is a small controller for entering the majority of the information and Phasmo Names is for entering the ghost name.
