The streamdecks are companions.  If you intend to enter the ghost name using the !gname command, then you only need the Phasmo Control stream deck.

The Phasmo Name stream deck works by using two variables to contain the first and last name.  The streamdeck button to swap back to the Phasmo Control streamdeck also calls a function that creates a Ghost name from the variables you've chosen.

Phasmo Controls

The top-left 6 items are the primary objectives that are entered as you find them.

The rest of the left side are the secondary objective options that you can enter into the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd secondary objective slot.  Secondary 1-3 marks S1-3 as complete.

Reset simply resets the forms.

Red Check, Ghost Name (Twitch), Ghost Name (Deck), and Ghost Type are not used directly.

The Phasmo Names button swaps to the Phasmo Names streamdeck.
