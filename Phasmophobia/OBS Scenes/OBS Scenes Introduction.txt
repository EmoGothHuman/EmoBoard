In this folder, I have provided a seen with all the required sources for the interactive overlay as seen on my stream.  

This can be edited and adjusted however you like so long as the names remain the same OR you edit the LioranBoard sourcenames to match when you make a change.

These are standard OBS scenes, so I don't know if they'll work with SLOBS.

To import:
Download the PhasmoOverlay.json file and put it somewhere that you can easily find and you won't delete it.
Open OBS Studio
Click Scene Collection in the top menu
Click Import
Use the three dots in the Collection Path field to open the Windows browser
Navigate to wherever you downloaded the .json file to and select it and click OK
Click Import

Click Scene Collection and you should see Phasmo in the Scene Collection list.  Select that and you should see the base overlay that I've designed.
