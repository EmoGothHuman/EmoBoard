LioranBoard Projects from EmoGothHuman

Welcome to the EmoBoard project!  This started as a fun project to create an interactive overlay for Phasmophobia and has shown me so much potential.

Caution:  I make no promises that these files will not cause unwanted actions on your system.  If there are crashes related to LioranBoard, I cannot help with those. These files are taken with an "As-Is" understanding.  I am a person who is playing with this in their spare time and can become bored at any moment.

That being said, I'm excited that you're taking a look at this and potentially interested in using what I've been working on!

Requirements:
PC (I work in Windows 10, but it may work in other OS's)
LioranBoard - https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/lioranboard-stream-deck-animator.862/

OBS (Standard OBS is what I use, not Streamlabs.  I have not tested in Streamlabs and honestly don't have the time nor the inclination to.) - https://obsproject.com/

OBS Websocket - https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/obs-websocket-remote-control-of-obs-studio-made-easy.466/

Licensing:
For the foreseeable future, all boards and scenes included here are being submitted without any use restrictions or attribution required.  The only thing I ask is that you let me know how you utilize my boards and scenes!  I would love to see the cool things that people do to make this more attractive and to fit their streams!

You can drop into my Discord here: https://discord.gg/FnTAEhbjUE or catch me on twitch.tv/emogothhuman

I hope you enjoy!
